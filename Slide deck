1. Slide deck outline (SVR Residents Hub)

Think: 6–8 slides, clean, minimal text, big readable fonts.

Slide 1 – Title

Title: SVR Residents Hub – Digital Support for Scottish Veterans Residences
Subtitle: A simple mobile app for residents at Whitefoord House, Rosendael & Bellrock Close
Footer: Prepared by: John Sutherland (Resident & Veteran)

Slide 2 – The Challenge

Heading: The daily challenges residents face

Hard to know who to speak to about housing, benefits, health or personal issues.

Repairs and issues reported informally – easy to lose track.

Important updates and events can be missed.

Navigating external services (NHS, benefits, charities) is confusing and overwhelming.

Sub-heading: The impact on staff

Time spent answering the same questions multiple times.

Manual logging and tracking of requests.

Pressure to communicate quickly during changes or emergencies.

Slide 3 – The Idea

Heading: SVR Residents Hub – a pocket support hub

A simple mobile app for residents + web dashboard for staff.

Designed specifically for Scottish Veterans Residences.

Co-created with residents and staff to be simple, clear and non-intimidating.

Key aim:
Make it easier to ask for help, get information and stay connected.

Slide 4 – Core Features for Residents (MVP)

Heading: What residents can do in the app

Today at SVR (Home screen)

Today’s meals, activities and events.

Quick buttons: Contact Support, Report a Repair, My Appointments.

Support Requests

Ask for help with benefits, housing, mental health, employment or “other”.

Mark urgency and preferred contact (in person / phone / message).

See status of requests: new → in progress → closed.

Maintenance / Repairs

Report non-emergency repairs (category, location, description, later photos).

Track whether requests have been received and actioned.

Slide 5 – Features for Staff & SVR

Heading: What staff gain

Staff dashboard (web):

View support and maintenance requests by residence and status.

Post announcements and events to one or all residences.

Manage a central resource library (links, PDFs, support contacts).

Better communication & visibility:

Clearer overview of resident needs and building issues.

Less time spent on admin and chasing information.

Early data to support reporting and future funding bids.

Slide 6 – Technology & Safety

Heading: Simple, secure, low-maintenance

Modern, lightweight technology:

Mobile app built once, runs on iOS and Android.

Secure API and database hosted in the cloud.

Staff dashboard accessible in a web browser.

Built with GDPR and privacy in mind:

Encrypted connections.

Role-based access (resident / staff / admin).

Only essential personal data stored.

Slide 7 – Pilot Proposal

Heading: Start small, prove value, then scale

Pilot plan (6–12 weeks):

Discovery & co-design

Short interviews/workshops with residents and staff from one residence.

Prototype & test

Early version focused on Support Requests, Repairs, Announcements.

Pilot launch in one site

Training sessions with residents and staff.

Review & scale

Measure usage, gather feedback, refine.

Decide on roll-out to all SVR residences.

Slide 8 – What I’m Asking For

Heading: How SVR and I can work together

Permission to run a small discovery and prototype phase.

A nominated staff contact / small working group (staff + residents).

Agreement on a pilot site and simple success criteria (e.g. app usage, staff time saved, resident feedback).

Closing line:
“As a resident and veteran, I’d be proud to build this with SVR to make daily life a bit easier for the people who live here.”
