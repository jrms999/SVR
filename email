Subject: Proposal: “SVR Residents Hub” – a simple app to support residents and staff

Dear [Name] / Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope you are well.

My name is John Sutherland, and I am a veteran and resident at Scottish Veterans Residences. I am writing to share an idea for a small digital project that I believe could make a meaningful difference to residents’ daily lives and to staff workloads.

Over the past months I have been thinking about how we, as residents, access support and information: who to speak to about housing or benefits, how we report repairs, and how we stay informed about events, activities and important updates. At the same time, staff are under pressure and spend a lot of time on repeated questions and manual admin.

To help with this, I would like to work with SVR to develop a simple “SVR Residents Hub” – a mobile app for residents (alongside a secure web dashboard for staff) that would:

Make it easier for residents to request support (benefits, housing, mental health, employment, etc.) and see the status of their requests.

Provide a clear way to report non-emergency repairs and track progress.

Share announcements, events and key information specific to each residence.

Offer a curated resource library with links to NHS, veterans’ charities, benefits guidance and other support.

My background combines military service with experience in technology and startups, and I am currently studying business and technology. I would like to use that experience to co-design and build this tool with SVR, in a way that is secure, realistic and tailored to residents’ needs.

I have attached a short concept overview / slide deck which outlines:

the problem this aims to address,

the core features of a first version (MVP),

the proposed technology approach, and

a small pilot plan focusing on one residence over 6–12 weeks.

What I am asking for at this stage is simply the opportunity to discuss this idea with you, and, if you feel it has merit, to:

identify a suitable staff contact or small working group (staff and residents), and

agree a sensible scope for a discovery + pilot phase.

I would be very happy to present the concept in person or over a call at a time that suits you.

Thank you for taking the time to consider this. I am grateful for the support SVR provides, and I would welcome the chance to contribute something practical back to the community.

Yours sincerely,
John Sutherland
